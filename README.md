Fabrik for J!4.x
================

This is a test version, not a complete working version of fabrik.

Work is in progress to get it al working.

Final version:
================

Working in J!4.1.x & PHP 8.1, does not work on <J!4.

Package removed (did not work and was not supported anyway).

All version hacks (release) removed, to be reimplemented for >J!4 and <J!5; we start with the latest J!4 version.

All unused functions removed (yes, there are some).

Possible to upgrade from J!3 to J!4. Don't install anything in the Joomla folders.

No sample application and several links removed from home dashboard.

Backend adapted for Atum template, frontend adapted for Cassiopeia template.

Only real working plugins and all of them in the standard package.

Default language is Enlish only, other language can be installed seperately.

Build and Install:
================

The build tool should be working now.
Temporary only plugins plg_fabrik_element_field, plg_fabrik_element_internalid, plg_fabrik_element_jdate and plg_fabrik_system are installed.
More plugins will be added as they are updated for J!4.

Temporary manually install mootools-core.js & mootools-more.js (from fabrik 3.10) in media\system\js.

Progress:
================

2022-07-10: 
Install is working, only temporary manually install mootools-core.js & mootools-more.js in media\system\js. 

A new list can be created and a new (field)element can be added. A list can be copied, can be trashed and trash can be emptied.
A new list menu item can be created and the frontend is also working. It only needs some styling.

All menu items (lists, forms, groups, elements,...) are updated to the Atum template.
